EVTEST(1)
=========

NAME
----

     evtest - Input device event monitor

SYNOPSIS
--------
     evtest "/dev/input/eventX"

DESCRIPTION
-----------
evtest displays information on the input device specified on the command
line, including all the events supported by the device. It then monitors the
device and displays all the events layer events generated.

evtest needs to be able to read from the device; in most cases this means it
must be run as root.

evtest is commonly used to debug issues with input devices in X.Org. The
output of evtest shows the information presented by the kernel; based on
this information it can be determined whether a bug may be a kernel or an
X.Org issue.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
If evtest does not show any events even though the device is being used, the
device may be grabbed by a process (EVIOCGRAB).  This is usually the case
when debugging a synaptics device from within X. VT switching to a TTY or
shutting down the X server terminates this grab and synaptics devices can be
debugged.
